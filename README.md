Concept

A tool to calculate best case scenario outcomes in where an equipment provider may give services to those willing to participate in a project demonstration session while efficiently implementing and maintaining previous projects for past consumers.

This routine manner provides the parameters for this tool.

Sales of product
Example
Air and water filtration equipment and services

Current methods

Dropping off flyers in where a client receives an incentive for participating in the service. Client must call the hotline to service provider and make the appointment. The service is where a product demonstration of the clients choice, air or water filtration, takes place in their home. The representative demonstrating the product and service carries all licencing for business as well all documentation for financial services if a purchase is to be made. 

This method relies on a homeowner only to make the call, accept the parameters as well as qualify for incentive. 

Issues
1. This results in a high rejection rate for turning the calls into appointments because youre removing a whole class of consumer, the renter, due to their contract with the landlord. 
2. Potentially qualified calls may try to make the appointment when the provider has moved on to the next service area. 
3. Unqualified calls and cancellations, usually from people not understanding the rules or lying, inheritently waste the time and income of all employees and contractors.
4. Finding the best route for each individiual advisor relies on the quality of the call. Moving between qualification areas takes time which equates to fuel costs, maintanence and operaton time.
5. Need security requirements for data retention and data privacy. This includes - are there rules for collecting this data under the company policy. 

Opportunities
1. See 4
2. Provide a charge to this back tracking of service
3. Quality control via office staff service. Qualify the potential client with prescreen targetted questions (Current method used when potential client calls in).
4. Quality data monitoring. Collect data and place targetted ads via all applicable social programs and applications to increase awareness whilst dropping flyers. The quality of client should increase as the people researching similar products or simply searching the market in general are a higher chance of revenue production than those calling on incentive to receive something just for spending their time.

5. By product - The potential clients calling in on flyers can now be used for training purposes or overrides whilst the higher qualified calls will be given to those with experience.
6. By product - Route times for servicers and demonstrators can be reduced
